# `Credit-Card-Default-Prediction 💳`
Internship for Ineuron

## `Problem Description`
Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.

## ` Objective `
Objective of our project is to predict which customer might default in upcoming months. Before going any further let's have a quick look on defination of what actually meant by Credit Card Default.
```
We are all aware what is credit card. It is type of payment payment card in which charges are made against a line of credit instead of the account holder's cash deposits. When someone uses a credit card to make a purchase, that person's account accrues a balance that must be paid off each month.

Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments.Missing credit card payments once or twice does not count as a default. A payment default occurs when you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due on the credit card for a few consecutive months.
```
## Dataset Information
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in _Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005_.

The datasets has been provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). The original dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This project wouldn't have been possible without this dataset.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.8 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
